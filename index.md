### I am an Evaluation & Analysis Engineer at the Semiconductor R&D Center of [Samsung Electronics](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/).

### In addition to my industry role, I am a part-time research assistant at [the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Lab](https://mlai.yonsei.ac.kr/home) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), where I am expanding my research experience under the guidance of Prof. [Kyungwoo Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=HWxRii4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

### Prior to joining MLAI, I earned my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Yonsei University as a part-time student while working full-time as an engineer at Samsung Electronics.  <br><br><br>
