# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Suho Kang!

I am an Evaluation & Analysis Engineer at the Semiconductor R&D Center of [Samsung Electronics](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/).

In addition to my industry role, I am a research assistant at [the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Lab](https://mlai.yonsei.ac.kr/home) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), where I earned my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence. Under the guidance of Prof. [Kyungwoo Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=HWxRii4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), I am further expanding my research experience.
